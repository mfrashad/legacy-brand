      <p>As a partner and Vice President with a large staffing company, for the past 15 years, I have witnessed thousands of Black Men and Women being processed to secure gainful employment. Week in and out, I have had the opportunity to place thousands of job seekers in short and long term opportunities. There is a commonality that exists with the majority of applicants that fill out lobbies on a day to day basis: place and position of birth. Oftentimes, the job seekers come from communities that are wrought with poverty, poor educational systems, lack of healthy food choices, and, most of all, jobs that pay a good living wage. Most, if not all of the jobs in the communities in which they inhabit pay wages that are so low that it requires the employee to work long hours to live at, if not right below the poverty line. This is a vicious cycle because it not only prevents them from seeking an education that will undoubtedly provide them with better paying job options, but it also creates an empty space in their homes, disabling the familial relationships. Their children end up raising themselves and their siblings and adult relationships suffer.</p>
      <p> As an Executive with one company, one who has first-hand experience witnessing this vicious unbroken cycle of in our community, I have a moral imperative to break it. I can no longer witness or people suffering without making every attempt to use my resources and experience to create a better tomorrow for our community.</p>
      <p>As with all the problems that we encounter, the solution is often hidden on the inside. The answer to this problem persisting in our community lies within us. We must return to and rebuild our inner cities and we must rely on our community, not governmental programs, handouts, or reparations to become the savior to our community. </p>
